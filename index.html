    <h3>🔍 Data Cleaning & Analysis</h3>
    <p>
      I enjoy turning messy datasets into clean, structured insights. I’ve worked with SQL and Excel to explore, validate, and transform data. Whether it’s joining tables, using pivot tables, or applying VLOOKUPs, I thrive on spotting trends and inconsistencies. Tools like Power BI and Tableau (at a beginner level) help me bring those insights to life with visuals that make sense to any audience.

I’ve written documentation, presented summaries to non-technical stakeholders, and built reports that tie data back to real business goals.
