    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I’m Yash, a Data Analyst based in Sydney, with a passion for turning raw data into meaningful insights. With hands-on experience across Australia and India, I’ve worked on sales analysis, dashboard design, and operations automation.</p>
    <p>I specialize in Power BI, SQL, and Excel—and I love uncovering trends that drive better business decisions. From startup environments to internship labs, I’ve tackled messy data, crafted clean visuals, and contributed to smart, data-driven cultures.</p>
    <p>I believe storytelling with data is an art—and I’m here to blend logic with design, curiosity with code, and numbers with narratives.</p>
